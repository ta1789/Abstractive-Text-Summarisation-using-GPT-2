# About
I implemented abstractive news article summarization using the GPT-2 model on the CNN/DailyMail dataset to generate concise and meaningful summaries of news articles.
To enhance text processing, I applied various NLP techniques, including stemming and lemmatization, before tokenizing the dataset with the GPT-2 Tokenizer API. 
I leveraged the Transformers API to import the pre-trained GPT-2 model and fine-tuned it for summarization.To improve the quality and coherence of generated summaries, 
I utilized advanced decoding strategies such as beam search and Top-K filtering. This approach ensured that the model produced concise, contextually relevant, and high-quality
summaries of news articles.
